## Why Use GitSense Chat?
<a id=why-use-gitsense-chat></a>
GitSense Chat is more than just a chat interface; it's a powerful platform designed to transform how users interact with their information and AI. Here are some of its key features:

### Empowering Code Creation with AI
<a id=collaborate-not-delegate></a>

The quality of AI-generated code is directly dependent on the clarity and precision of human instructions. Understand every piece of generated code, with full traceability back to its conversational origin, versioning, and authorship. This isn't about humans versus AI; it's about **empowering humans** to achieve more by effectively guiding AI.

### Seamless Data Integration
<a id=seamless-data-integration></a>

**AI <-> Your Data:** GitSense Chat lets you chat directly with your own information using Large Language Models. This means you can now chat with your codebase and other development data, turning them into interactive knowledge sources.

This capability is powered by the **GitSense Chat Bridge** (available in both free and commercial versions). The Bridge seamlessly imports your Git repositories into the application, transforming your code into an interactive knowledge base. We are actively expanding its capabilities to integrate with GitHub issues, pull requests, and more, ensuring all your development data is AI-ready.

## Installation
<a id=installation></a>

### NPM
<a id=npm></a>

Run GitSense Chat directly using Node.js and npm.

#### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or higher recommended) and npm installed.
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the GitSense Chat repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gitsense/chat.git
cd chat
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned directory and install the project dependencies. This step will also automatically build the necessary frontend assets.

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `chat` directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file and fill in your API keys for the AI model providers you wish to use (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).

```bash
# Example: Copy the template to create your .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Now, open .env in a text editor and add your API keys
# nano .env
```

> **Important:** If GitSense Chat is currently running, you must stop and then start the application after updating your `.env` file for the changes to take effect.

#### 4. Start the Application

From the `chat` directory, start the application. This uses `forever` (a dependency installed via `npm install`) to keep the application running in the background.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be accessible on port `3357`.

#### 5. Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to: [http://localhost:3357](http://localhost:3357)

#### 6. Stop the Application

To stop the running application:

```bash
npm stop
```

#### Additional Commands

*   **Check Status:** `npm status`
*   **View Logs:** `npm logs` (Note: `npm logs` is not a standard npm script. You would typically use `forever logs` if `forever` is installed globally, or inspect logs directly from the `forever` process. For simplicity, `npm status` will show if it's running.)

### Docker
<a id=docker></a>

Run GitSense Chat as a Docker container for easy setup and portability.

#### Prerequisites

*   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for Windows/macOS) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (for Linux) installed and running.

#### 1. Download the Docker Image

```bash
docker pull gitsense/chat
```

#### 2. Retrieve Helper Tools and Configuration

Download the `gsc-docker` helper script and the `.env.example` template. Its main purpose is to significantly simplify managing GitSense Chat as a Docker container. These files should be placed in a dedicated directory on your machine (e.g., `~/gitsense-chat-docker/`).

```bash
# Create a directory for your Docker setup (optional, but recommended)
mkdir -p ~/gitsense-chat-docker
cd ~/gitsense-chat-docker

# Download the gsc-docker helper script
curl -o gsc-docker https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitsense/chat/main/bin/gsc-docker

# Download the .env.example template
curl -o .env.example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitsense/chat/main/.env.example

# Make the gsc-docker script executable
chmod +x gsc-docker
```

**Important:** For convenience, you can move the `gsc-docker` script to a directory in your system's `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/`). If you don't, you'll need to run it with `./gsc-docker` from the directory where you saved it.

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the **same directory** where you downloaded `gsc-docker` and `.env.example` (e.g., `~/gitsense-chat-docker/`).

Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file and fill in your API keys for the AI model providers you wish to use.

```bash
# Example: Copy the template to create your .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Now, open .env in a text editor and add your API keys
# nano .env
```

> **Important:** If GitSense Chat is currently running, you must stop and then start the application after updating your `.env` file for the changes to take effect.

#### 4. Start the Application

Navigate to the directory containing your `.env` file (e.g., `~/gitsense-chat-docker/`) and run:

```bash
gsc-docker start
```

This command will:
*   Create a persistent Docker volume for your application data.
*   Mount your `.env` file into the container.
*   Start the GitSense Chat application, accessible on port `3357`.

#### 5. Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to: [http://localhost:3357](http://localhost:3357/)

#### 6. Stop the Application

To stop and remove the running container:

```bash
gsc-docker stop
```

#### Additional Commands

*   **Check Status:** `gsc-docker status`
*   **View Logs:** `gsc-docker logs` (Press `Ctrl+C` to exit)

The JavaScript files in this repository are currently provided in a minified distribution. While we finalize the adoption of the **Fair License**, the core terms are as follows:

You are permitted to use and modify this software for **internal, non-commercial purposes**. This means you can integrate GitSense Chat into your workflows, adapt it to your specific needs, and learn from its codebase. However, **copying for profit or redistribution is strictly not permitted**, nor can this software be used to develop or enhance any product or service that directly or indirectly competes with GitSense Chat without explicit permission. Once the Fair License is formally adopted, the unminified source code will be made freely available under these terms.

## Full Business Model Details
<a id=full-business-model-details></a>

GitSense Chat is designed to be a free-to-use application, providing **significant** value to individual developers and teams. Our business model focuses on ensuring the long-term sustainability and continued development of the platform through a commercial offering of the **GitSense Chat Bridge**.

GitSense Chat's **key strength** lies in its ability to import and manage software development data, such as Git repositories, and coordinate indexing at scale. The free version of the GitSense Chat Bridge, while functional, has inherent limitations due to its JavaScript implementation, which currently lacks support for multithreading and other advanced performance optimization capabilities.

Our goal is to generate revenue by charging for a commercial version of the GitSense Chat Bridge. This commercial bridge will offer enhanced performance and scalability, along with significantly more powerful search features, allowing companies to create advanced context engines for use when chatting with LLMs. This approach enables us to keep the core GitSense Chat application free and accessible to everyone, fostering a wide user base while monetizing the specialized, high-performance data ingestion component that is critical for enterprise-level adoption.
