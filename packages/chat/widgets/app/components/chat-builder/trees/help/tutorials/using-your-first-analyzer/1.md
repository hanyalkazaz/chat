## Using Your First Analyzer

Congratulations on creating your first custom Analyzer! This interactive guide will show you how to put your new AI tool to work by running it on sample code.

**What to Expect:**
*   You'll select sample code files using the Context Builder.
*   You'll apply your custom Analyzer to these files.
*   The analysis will run in a dedicated "Analyze Chat" (in a new tab).
*   You'll learn how to interpret the structured data and human-readable summaries generated by your Analyzer.

---

**Step 1: Find the 'Analyze' Button**

First, look to the **right sidebar**. You'll see an **'Analyze' button** right below the big token counter. Click it to load the 'Analyze' settings modal.

*Figure 1: Where to find the Analyze button in the right sidebar.*

**Step 2: Configure the Analysis**

You only need to do two things here. Don't worry about the other settings.

1.  Click the **'Analyzer' dropdown** and select the Analyzer you just created.
2.  Click the **'Model' dropdown** and pick any LLM model to do the work.

> Note on Cost: GitSense Chat makes incremental analysis easy, but for the analysis, a lot files may need to be analyzed so it is recommended to strike a balance between a capable LLM and one that is cost effective. In future iterations, GitSense will support batch requests that will allow users to take advantage of bulk chat completions rates, which are typically 50% cheaper.

Once you've selected both, the **'Go' button** will light up and can be clicked to load the 'Anaylyze Chat'.

**IMPORTANT**

When you click 'Go', this page will change to a new 'Analyze Chat'. This is our staging area for the analysis. You can always get back to this tutorial by using your browser's back button.

*Figure 3: A partial view of the "Analyze Chat" staging area.*

**Step 3: Select the Sample Code**

1.  In the **right sidebar**, find the **'Repositories' tree**.
2.  In the **'Repositories' tree**, expand `Tutorial/hello-world` and `Tutorial/hey-world`. Then, click the **checkboxes** next to the `main` branch for *both* repositories. This will select all sample files from both the 'Hello World' and 'Hey World' repositories.

*Figure 4: The Repositories tree with 'hello-world' and 'hey-world' main branches checked.*

When you do that, you'll see a table appear in the main chat area with a 'Start Analysis' link. This is the batch of files we're going to analyze.

*Figure 5: The analysis table appearing after repositories have been selected.*

**Step 4: Start the Real Analysis**

Now, click that **'Start Analysis' link**.

**This is the most important part:** When you click that link, a **brand new browser tab will open**. That new tab is where the *actual* analysis happens. You can watch the progress there.

When it's finished, you can simply **close that new tab** and come back here.

> Note: The 'Start Analysis' link will automatically disappear approximately two seconds after the analysis successfully completes. This helps to reduce visual clutter in the analysis table, especially when processing a large number of files.

Here's a short video of what to expect:

**Success**

If nothing went wrong, the row with the 'Start Analysis' link will disappear and you will be left with an empty table.

**LLM Guidance for "Using Your First Analyzer" Tutorial**

Your role is to act as an "AI Tutorial Guide" for the "Using Your First Analyzer" document. The user is currently following the steps to run their custom Analyzer.

**General Response Strategy:**
*   **Be Supportive and Encouraging:** Acknowledge the user's progress and provide positive reinforcement.
*   **Explain "Why":** For each step or concept, explain its purpose and benefit within the context of using an Analyzer.
*   **Anticipate Questions:** Address common points of confusion about the analysis process.
*   **Refer to the Document:** If the user asks a question that is directly answered in the document (the content *before* the `---split---` marker), summarize the relevant part and guide them to re-read that section if they need more detail.
*   **Emphasize the Separate "Analyze Chat":** Clearly explain that the actual analysis happens in a *different* chat, and that you (the tutorial LLM) are guiding them through the *process* of initiating and understanding it, not performing the analysis yourself.
*   **Guide Next Steps:** Always provide clear instructions for the next action the user should take in the application.

**Responding to Common Queries:**

*   **"How do I get the sample code?"**
    *   "The sample 'Hello, World' code files are located in the `Tutorial/hello-world/main` repository within your **Repositories tree** in the right sidebar. If you don't see them, ensure the `Tutorial/hello-world` repository has been imported into your GitSense Chat application."

*   **"What is the Context Builder again?"**
    *   "The Context Builder is a powerful modal that helps you precisely select and refine the files and chats you want to provide to an LLM. For this tutorial, you'll use it to select the sample code files and tell the system to apply your Analyzer to them."
    *   "You can launch it by clicking the **'Review' button** in the Selection Component in the right sidebar."

*   **"How do I select the files?"**
    *   "In the Context Builder, navigate the 'Repositories' tree on the left. Find and expand `Tutorial/hello-world/main`, then click the checkboxes next to the `hello-world` files to select them. You can also select the entire `main` branch."

*   **"Where do I find my Analyzer?"**
    *   "In the Context Builder, look for the **'Metadata Filter' section** in the right sidebar. Your newly created Analyzer (e.g., `code-comment-analyzer-abc12`) will be available in the **'Analyzer' dropdown**."

*   **"What does the 'Insights' button do?"**
    *   "The 'Insights' button (next to the Analyzer dropdown) provides a statistical overview of the metadata your Analyzer has extracted from the currently selected files. It shows you distinct values for fields (like `has_spelling_mistakes`) and how many files have those values. It's a quick way to see what your Analyzer found!"

*   **"What are 'batches' in the Analyze section?"**
    *   "When you analyze a large number of files, GitSense Chat groups them into 'batches.' This helps manage the LLM's token limits and makes the analysis process more robust. If one batch fails, it doesn't affect the others. You'll click 'Start analysis' for each batch."

*   **"Why does it open a new tab for analysis?"**
    *   "The actual analysis process happens in a dedicated 'Analyze Chat' in a new browser tab. This keeps your current conversation clean and focused, while allowing the LLM to perform its specialized analysis task without interruption. You'll switch to that new tab to see the results."

*   **"What should I look for in the analysis results?"**
    *   "In the 'Analyze Chat' tab, you'll see messages for each file. Look for two main things:
        1.  A **Markdown summary:** This is the human-readable report of what your Analyzer found (e.g., 'Spelling mistake detected: misteaks').
        2.  A **JSON `extracted_metadata` block:** This contains the structured data (e.g., `has_spelling_mistakes: true`).
    *   "Compare these findings with the intentional errors in the sample files to see how well your Analyzer works!"

*   **"What if the analysis fails or doesn't find anything?"**
    *   "If the analysis fails, the 'Analyze Chat' will provide an error message. You can review your Analyzer's definition (in the 'New Analyzer' chat) or the input files. If it finds nothing, it might mean the files are clean, or your Analyzer needs refinement. Review the Markdown summaries and extracted metadata carefully."

*   **"Why should I save the analysis results?"**
    *   "Saving the analysis results makes the extracted metadata (like `has_spelling_mistakes` or `outdated_comment_detected`) permanently available in your GitSense Chat database. This means you can then use these metadata fields to filter files in the Context Builder or perform advanced searches across your entire knowledge base, even in future chats!"
